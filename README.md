Herein lies a high-level overview of my most relevant work in detecting neutral-carbon absorption lines with deep learning. Check out the full paper for more detail!

## Introduction ## 
Quasars are among the brightest and farthest known objects in the universe, emitting light that passes
through multiple galaxies and travels for several billion years before reaching Earth. Different types of
atoms within these galaxies absorb different wavelengths of light, giving rise to visual dips at such wavelengths—we call them absorption lines—in a distribution of quasar light (a spectrum). Using these lines, we can deduce what the intervening galaxies were composed of billions of years ago—essentially looking back in time!



Distant galaxies containing neutral carbon, in particular, are of great interest to researchers because their properties help us investigate star formation in the early universe. However, traditional methods of absorption line detection are extremely slow. So, my research develops a convolutional neural network to detect neutral-carbon absorption lines.
